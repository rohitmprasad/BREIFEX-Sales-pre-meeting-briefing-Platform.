Briefex Agentic Workflow
Breifex orchestrates 5 specialised AI agents through a no-code workflow that converts Slack triggers into meeting-ready briefs in <10 minutes. Here's the complete flow with agent roles and execution stages:

Workflow 
    [Input]A --> [Slack Trigger] B --> [Meeting Parser Agent]
    B --> C1[Attendee Insights Agent]
    B --> C2[Company Insights Agent]
    C1 + C2 --> D[Brief Assembly Agent]
    D --> E[Slack Output Agent]
    F [Slack response]
    F --> G [Feedback Agent][Optional , if sales rep provides feedback]
    E / G --> H [Objection Learning Agent] [ If sales rep approved initial brief]
    H --> I [ Slack node [ Full brief + Objections shared] 
    

Complete 7-Stage Agentic Pipeline

Stage 1: Trigger & Parse
[Message received] → [Condition] → [Identify meeting] → [Calendar sync]

    Agent 1: Meeting Parser Agent
    
    Role: Extracts attendees, company, and timing from Slack command or calendar event
    
    Output: Structured JSON: {meeting_id, attendees[], company, time}

Stage 2: Parallel Intelligence 
[Get event details] ──┐
                      ├─→ [Attendee Insights Agent]
                      └─→ [Company Insights Agent]

    Agent 2: Attendee Insights Agent
    Fetches LinkedIn profiles, roles, and recent activity
    Maps relationships (decision-maker vs. influencer)
    Output: attendee_profiles: [{name, role, influence_score, talking_points}]

    Agent 3: Company Insights Agent
    Pulls CRM data, recent news, Financial /PR, News 
    Identifies strategic priorities and pain points
    Output: company_context: {business_model, recent_events, Financial news / new releases / PR }


Stage 3: Brief Synthesis
[Extract att. names] + [Extract comp. context] → [Pre-meeting Brief]

    Agent 4: Brief Assembly Agent
    Merges parallel agent outputs into Pre-meeting breif format
    Generates conversation starters, next-steps
    Output: Structured brief (Summary: company intel + attendee mapping + Conversational starts + next steps )

Stage 4: Delivery + Sales rep response if any 
[Concise meeting brief] → [Send reply]

Stage 5: Continuous Refinement/Feedback Agents + Objection Handling agent 

    Agent 5: Feedback Agent  
    Collects feedback from the sales rep's response on the brief, analyses it and checks if the current brief needs refinement.
    [ Feedback on future refinement stored in Google Docs for the agent to refer to later for future briefs]
    Agents self-improve via stored objection patterns
    Future briefs include predictive objection handlers

Stage 5: Objection handling 

  Agent 5: Objection Learning Agent
  Monitors rep's post-meeting Slack responses and provides min 3 to 4 key objections and how to handle them 
  Identifies objection patterns ("budget concerns", "competitor mentioned")
  Stores for future brief personalisation


Stage 6: Final Output: 

  Final Brief + Objections handling script is sent back to Slack for the sales rep to read before attending the meeting. 


Platform: Lindy.AI agentic workflows
Integrations: Slack, Google Calendar, CRM, LinkedIn API, GPT-4o, Perplexity deep search.

Data Flow: JSON between 27+ nodes, full error handling
Deployment: Live with 5 EdTech sales reps (pilot)
This architecture scales from 1→100 reps by adding parallel instances while objection learning compounds value over time. Pure no-code agentic systems thinking.
